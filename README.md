# LSTM-Netwoks
The basic intution behind what lstm is remember what happened before. In simple term while we reading something we are not understanding each sentence seperate. While reading a line we have a understanding about what was on the previous line. This lstm network is a method of implementing the same.
Recurrent neural networks are solution for the same and they allow the information to persist in the them ,ie they have a loop to keep the information.
While say like a loop its bit confusing and its nothing but an array of network which will feed the information to the successor
